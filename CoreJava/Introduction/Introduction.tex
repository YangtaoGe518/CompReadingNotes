\section{Chapter 1: An Introdcution to Java}
\begin{abstract}
This chapter notes will only focus on \textbf{Buzzwords} in Java and some related definition.
Details will be required to refer to the actual book.

These 11 buzzword is: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simple
    \item Object-oriented
    \item Distributed
    \item Robust
    \item Secure
    \item Architecture-Neutral
    \item Portable
    \item Interpreted
    \item High-Performance
    \item Multithreaded
    \item Dynamic
\end{itemize}
\end{abstract}

\subsection{Buzzword}
The detail definitions of these buzzword are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[\textbf{Simple}] in C++ syntax, but be \textbf{simpler} to use 
    and \textbf{smaller} to install
    \item[\textbf{Object-oriented}] Focusing on the \textbf{data} and on the \textbf{interfaces} to that Object
    \item[\textbf{Distributed}] It has an extensive library of routines for coping with TCP/IP protocols like HTTP and FTP
    \item[\textbf{Robust}] It has \textbf{early checking} for possible problems, \textbf{Dynamic checking}
    and \textbf{eliminating situations} that are error-prone.
    \item[\textbf{Secure}] Three kinds of attacks impossible:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Overrunning the running time stack
            \item corrupting memory outside its process space
            \item Reading and writting without permission
        \end{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{Architecture-Neutral}] Running on any Operating systems and Computer Architectures
    by using \underline{Java's virtual machine} 
    \item[\textbf{Portable}] No ``implementation-dependent'' i.e. The \textit{size} of data type are specified
    \item[\textbf{Interpreted}] The Java Interoreter can execute Java bytecodes on any machine to which the interpreter has been ported.
    \item[\textbf{High-Performance}] Java bytecodes are more than \textit{adequate}
    \item[\textbf{Multithreaded}] support ``Concurrent'' and has lots of benefits.
    \item[\textbf{Dynamic}] more Dynamic than C++. i.e. running time is strictly divided from compiling time    
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Java applets and the internet}
Java program that works on web pages are called \emph{applets}. Running it needs a web browser
which can \textbf{exectue Java bytecode} for you.

This allow a web page:
\begin{itemize}
    \item reacts user commands
    \item changes its appearance
    \item exchange data between \underline{clinet} and \underline{server}
\end{itemize}
